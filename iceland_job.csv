The places we visited are true wonders of nature. My daughter and I were very lucky to have a very friendly and knowledgeable guide as well as a perfect day weatherwise.
Wally was great, very informative. He waited for those who took a bit longer than the others so that we could see all the sights. Managed to squeeze in a few extra stops for us which were breath taking. A very cheery and pleasant young man, no doubt a credit to your team."
